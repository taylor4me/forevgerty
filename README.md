So I do my best to master the language because I have made up my mind to apply to the Linguistic University and become either a teacher 
or an interpreter. I haven't chosen it yet. Both professions are interesting and
necessary in our society. Perhaps, I'll keep our family tradition and become a teacher of English. But I'll think about it tomorrow if I enter the University.
